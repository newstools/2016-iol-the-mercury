Durban - Members of the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislature have commended the Royal Household Trust for its improvement in handling King Goodwill Zwelithini&#x2019;s family budget.The trust&apos;s financial manager, Sipho Buthelezi, told the public accounts standing committee at the legislature in Pietermaritzburg on Friday that the trust&#x2019;s books had improved when compared with previous years.While there were a few things that the auditor-general had raised as matters of concern, the trust had managed to correct them.&#x201C;The main issue was in the performance information where weakness were identified. We are working with the office of the premier&#x2019;s strategic planning. They are assisting us on addressing those issues, and we are hoping that in the 2016/17 year most of them would be cleared,&#x201D; said Buthelezi.ANC MPL Sipho Nkosi said the trust still had challenges that it had to deal with.&#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t understand why the responsible officials don&#x2019;t address them once and for all.&#x201C;Because they have been recurring for so long, I think you owe us (an explanation) when we meet you next year, as to what action are you are going to take,&#x201D; said Nkosi.

Durban - Religious leaders have given contradicting reaction to the Liquor Bill, which the government wants to use in restricting the use of alcohol.The bill has since last week been subjected to public comments. It will soon be debated in Parliament and later sent to President Jacob Zuma for final approval.In its current form, the bill meant that liquor outlets within a radius of 500m from religious, educational, health and recreation facilities would have to shut down.Tavern owners fear that the bill could cost them their businesses, and that they would be forced to lay off employees.Max Mqadi of Max&#x2019;s Lifestyle in uMlazi felt that it would be wrong for his business, which employs 150 people, to shut down in favour of a church that was close to his business.He said the church should rather close, since it provided neither jobs nor tax revenue.The Rev Brett Williams of St Joseph&#x2019;s Catholic Church in Florida Road, Durban, said the church was concerned about the abuse of alcohol, but was against the shutting down of the outlets close to churches.He said the bill might be amended to remove the &#x201C;quite contentious issue&#x201D; that was against the sale of alcohol near places of worship.He was not sure how the alcohol trade affected the church.He said the church was not anti-alcohol at all.&#x201C;We are not totally against people using alcohol for relaxation, enjoyment and socially. It is the abuse that we are concern about.&#x201C;If there is a place of alcohol not far from the church, that in itself is not the issue.&#x201D;He said the church&#x2019;s view was informed by the fact that there were many people whose livelihood depended on the entertainment industry.&#x201C;If this new law were passed, all the Florida Road establishments would shut down, and I don&#x2019;t think the church is in favour of that. I don&#x2019;t think the church is proposing the loss of jobs and income,&#x201D; he said.However, he said Catholic Cardinal Wilfrid Napier was &#x201C;very&#x201D; vocal in his concern about people suffering from addiction.&#x201C;Napier has taken a number of measures in Durban to address this problem. There is an anti-addiction prayer campaign.&#x201C;He is also looking at the establishment of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre,&#x201D; he said.The Rev Thandazile Zulu of the Free Methodist Church in KwaMashu said the close proximity of churches and many taverns was wrong and the bill should be passed as it was.She said her church was near a small shebeen, which had caused problems. She said on Sunday intoxicated people would walk into the church causing chaos and disturbing sermons.&#x201C;To say taverns were paying tax and employing people does not hold water, because there are lots of people who have lost control of their lives because of alcohol,&#x201D; said Zulu.Williams disagreed that the church did not pay tax.&#x201C;The church pays tax-paying service providers. But we are exempted from direct tax and paying rates for the property,&#x201D; he said. The Mercury IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter

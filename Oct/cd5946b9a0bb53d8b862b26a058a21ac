Durban - A lottery windfall which soured a relationship between two friends has been exposed in a court battle over whether or not cash of R600 000 and an expensive car given by one to the other were gifts or were loans which had to be repaid.Roderick Naidoo claims that on the night his friend Valla Kumarasamy won the undisclosed amount, he promised to buy him the Mercedes-Benz and to settle his bond.But Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Peter Olsen, who presided over a trial in which Kumarasamy sued Naidoo for the money, ruled that &#x201C;while Lotto winners might say unwise things and make silly promises&#x201D;, these were not always enforceable and had to be seen in context.Kumarasamy, of Howick, made six payments between September 2011 and January 2012 totalling R600 000 to Naidoo, who was involved in a relationship with his daughter Cheryl.Evidence before Judge Olsen was that Kumarasamy and Naidoo - who was still married to another woman at the time - had initially fallen out over the relationship, but after meeting up at a funeral in 2010, decided life was too short to be carrying on as they had and the friendship was renewed.Kumarasamy won the Lotto in July 2011. The first payments were made when Naidoo, who was getting divorced, needed money to pay into his bond and to clear a municipal debt. The other payments were made the following year to settle the bond.At some point, the Mercedes-Benz was bought and registered in Kumarasamy&#x2019;s name.The following August, after a family meeting, the friendship came to a final end and Naidoo and Cheryl Kumurasamy broke up. Naidoo disclosed he had transferred the car into his own name. Kumarasamy regarded this as fraud or theft and reported the matter to the police. He also sued Naidoo for the loans.Naidoo denied owing the money, insisting it had been donated to him, and also claimed the car had been bought for him, which the judge noted &#x201C;would lift the generosity to well clear of R1 million&#x201D;.Naidoo said proof of this was the fact that the personalised number plate was a version of his name. But Cheryl Kumarasamy, who claimed the car was in fact a gift to her from her father, said her name was going to be put on the number plate, but it was already taken.&#x201C;In the end the car was reregistered in Kumarasamy&#x2019;s name, Naidoo claiming that as it had been gifted to him, he was gifting it back,&#x201D; Judge Olsen said.&#x201C;This, he claimed was because of his religious conviction. He did not explain, however, why his conviction did not extend to returning the money claimed in this action.&#x201D;The judge referred to documents submitted to the court, both of which referred to the money as being &#x201C;loans&#x201D;.He said Naidoo tried to explain this away, alleging the true nature of the transactions had to be hidden not only because of his own divorce, but because Lotto authorities had advised against giving &#x201C;donations&#x201D; because they had tax implications.&#x201C;His (Naidoo&#x2019;s case) rests exclusively on a promise made the night the Lotto was won, the existence of which promise was not put to Kumarasamy (in cross-examination).&#x201C;This version does him no credit and I reject it,&#x201D; he said, ordering that Naidoo pay back the R600 000 plus interest, and pay costs of the case.

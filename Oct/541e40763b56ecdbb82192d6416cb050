Durban - KwaZulu-Natal premier Willies Mchunu on Sunday confirmed reports about his ill health, but said he was still fit to lead the province.His confession followed speculation about his health and that he might not finish his term as premier.The Mercury&apos;s sister newspaper, the Sunday Tribune reported on Sunday that he had failed to attend some government events because of poor health, and that he had recently been admitted to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban. The paper also said there was a prediction in the ANC that he might hand over to the party provincial chairman and MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala, before his term ended in 2019.Mchunu told The Mercury on Sunday that he was suffering from &quot;problematic&quot; sinusitis and allergies.&quot;If sinus has post-nasal drip that has reached the lungs it has to be killed with antibiotics. If you say Willies is ill, I can&apos;t say no I am not ill&apos;,&quot; he said.When asked if he was still fit to lead the government, Mchunu, who is normally called &quot;umkhulu&quot; (old man) in the ANC and government, said: &quot;If I could not do my job I would not be here with you right now.&quot;Now you can see that I am here to work on a Sunday, which is not the first time. I am going to work until night.&quot;He could not speculate whether he would finish his term &quot;as that was up to the ANC to decide&quot;.He said when speculation was first made before 2014 it was true, &quot;but I am still in government today&quot;.&quot;If you say Willies is not going to last long in this government you might be telling the truth.&quot;I grew up in the school of the ANC, which taught me not to ask to be deployed. You also don&apos;t ask not to be deployed. If the ANC says don&apos;t go to work today, go and live with your grandchildren I will,&apos;&quot; he said.

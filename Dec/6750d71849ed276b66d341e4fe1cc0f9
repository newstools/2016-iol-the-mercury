Durban - Nkandla residents are reeling after the murder of a community development worker in the area.The body of Nkosiyapha Nokuthula Florence Mthembu, 44, was found at a nearby dam earlier this week. KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, said that Mthembu s murder was a terrible loss as she had been a committed employee .She said that she had delegated a team of officials to meet the family and offer them support. The nature of this work demands that community development workers be visible within their communities, and it saddens us to see such a tragic incident happen in a community that this particular worker sought to serve with all her heart.&nbsp;&quot;As her employers, we are shocked by this senseless murder, said Dube-Ncube.&nbsp;The Mercury

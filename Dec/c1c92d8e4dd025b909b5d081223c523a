A note had also been left which said that the person could no longer look after the child.Nurse Zoh Ngcobo was among the first at the scene and she said the baby boy s eyes were swollen from crying and that he was hungry.She took the baby to the hospital where he was stabilised.Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said it was a hard case to crack.The docket was opened at Westville police station initially but it was later handed over to the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit There were no witnesses, Gwala said.The child s mother did leave a note apologising for what she had done and asking whoever found the baby to bring him up but it did not reveal much about her identitiy&quot;, Gwala said.Detectives discovered that some medication that was left with the child was issued at St Mary's Hospital in Mariannhill.But further investigations revealed that the mother had registered an incomplete residential address and did not leave her cellphone number.

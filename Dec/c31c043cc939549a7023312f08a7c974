Durban - Netcare 911 paramedics in Durban helped deliver a baby boy in the back of an ambulance on Sunday morning.His mother had gone into labour while walking along the railway lines in Shongweni, Netcare 911 spokesman Chris Botha said. Paramedics had to walk with all their equipment for some distance along the railway line until they got to the patient, Botha said. When they got to her, they found she was in the second stage of labour and after assessing her, they immobilised her on a trauma board and, with the assistance of bystanders, carried her back to the ambulance. But no sooner had paramedics started on their way to hospital, when it became apparent that the little one was on his way. They had to stop as she started to deliver the baby, Botha said.The little boy was welcomed into the world at 10.18am.Medics treated the mother and the baby and then transported them to hospital for further treatment.The Mercury

Durban - It could be a devastating Christmas for two KwaZulu-Natal people whose unclaimed winning Lotto ticket expires in the next week. One ticket worth R10 million, bought last month at the Moonlight Superette in Merebank will expire on Friday. Another, worth about R 1.6m was bought at a Pick n Pay at Arbor Crossing in Amanzimtoti, and expires next Monday. The winners played those tickets last year. Winners have 365 days to claim their tickets before they expire. Ithuba, the national lottery operator, advised the public to check their tickets regularly and validate them at their nearest retailer or visit Ithuba offices to see whether they had winning numbers. Ithuba urged the winners to contact them to claim their winnings. They can be reached on their helpline 0800 484 822. The Mercury

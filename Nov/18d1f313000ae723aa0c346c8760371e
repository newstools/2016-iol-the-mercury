Durban - A teenager, who was implicated in the murder of Chatsworth prostitute Desiree Murugan, told the court on Tuesday that he was not there when the crime was committed and was only told to carry a backpack from the scene.The teenager, who is not being named because he was a minor when he was arrested, told the court that while he had been present on the night of the murder he had not been involved in the decapitation of Murugan.Murugan was lured to a sports ground in Shallcross where she was stabbed more than 100 times and beheaded in August 2014.The State alleges Murugan was killed because a traditional healer had offered R2 million if he could get the head of an Indian, coloured or white female.The traditional healer, Sibona-kaliso Mbili, his assistant Vusumuzi Gumede and three minors were arrested in connection with the crime.Mbili and the three minors, including a girl, are on trial for murder while Gumede has been charged with defeating the ends of justice and being an accessory after the fact. All five have pleaded not guilty.Last year the State closed its case after the court heard testimony from former accused Falakhe Khumalo, who is serving a life sentence for his participation in the murder.Khumalo said Mbili had promised to pay him R2 million if he could procure the head of a Indian, coloured or white female, to be used for muti.He told the court that he and the two teenage boys who are on trial had participated in the decapitation but one of the teenagers denied this on Tuesday.He told the court that he had not seen any weapons on the night of the murder and he was only called to the scene and told by Khumalo to carry a bag.However State advocate Cheryl Naidu told the teenager that his version in his testimony before the court was different to the version described earlier by his attorney.Naidu also said the teenager on Tuesday told the court he had heard about a R2-million payment but on Monday he had denied knowledge of it.&#x201C;You have given the court completely inconsistent versions which suggests that you are making up your version.&#x201D;The teenager replied: &#x201C;I have been in custody for a long time and I forget things and I get confused when I am being asked the same question three times.&#x201D;The case continues.

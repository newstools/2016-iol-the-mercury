Durban - Nobuhle Khuzwayo lost her mother many years ago. Her father does not play an active role in her life and her aunt, who raised her, is disabled. Last month, before the start of her matric exams, Nobuhle and her family were evicted from their home.But this courageous young woman&#x2019;s attitude is contagious. She has a wide smile and eyes that laugh. Her voice is warm and she talks &#x201C;with her hands&#x201D;. A straight-A student, Nobuhle has charisma aplenty and big dreams.Everyone at Ohlange High School - the historic Inanda institution where she is completing matric - knows Nobuhle and as she dances through the hallways everyone greets her. She has a happy-go-lucky air about her but beneath this is a young girl who, at just 18, has already experienced many struggles.&#x201C;There are times when no-one seems to care but you just have to be strong,&#x201D; she says. Nobuhle lost her mother 10 years ago. &#x201C;She suffered a lot before she died. I wasn&#x2019;t happy to see her like that,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t happy that she died, but it is all part of a bigger plan.&#x201D;She says that if her mother were still here, she might not be the strong woman she has become. &#x201C;I might not work as hard, because I might feel like I had a mom who could just do everything for me,&#x201D; she said.Nobuhle remembers her mom as a very strong woman. &#x201C;I think she would be really, really proud of me,&#x201D; she says.After her mother&#x2019;s death, Nobuhle&#x2019;s father left and their relationship remains strained. She grows emotional talking about it. &#x201C;But I&#x2019;ll be a better person in the future, I will never do this to my children.&#x201D;Nobuhle is being raised by a maternal aunt, who she calls &#x201C;Mom&#x201D; and who became disabled after a botched surgery following a fall a few years ago. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very strong, but seeing her like that...&#x201D; Nobuhle&#x2019;s voice trails off. She says her aunt used to do everything for her.&#x201C;But now it&#x2019;s very hard for her,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;She says she wishes things were different but I tell her that this isn&#x2019;t the end, that I&#x2019;m going to finish school and go to university and do well.&#x201D;Her aunt, Qinisile Mbokazi, says she misses being able to take care of Nobuhle. But she is very proud of her and sees a great future ahead for her.Nobuhle hopes to be the first of her family to go to university. &#x201C;I will be,&#x201D; she says.And she hopes to buy her family a house one day. Last month, the woman who owned the house she was living in told them they had to move out. Her aunt could not afford the rent; her disability prevents her from working and Nobuhle&#x2019;s older sister, who stays in Johannesburg, supports them.&#x201C;But she also has to pay rent where she lives and she has to go to work,&#x201D; Nobuhle says.This all happened just days before Nobuhle&#x2019;s final exams started. Fortunately the Ohlange family takes care of its own and her former school principal - Thamsanqa Dladla, who was already sponsoring her school fees and uniform - stepped in.&#x201C;I told him I had a problem, that I wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to write my exams because my family had to move out,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;So he spoke to the current principal and then I moved in here at the hostel so I could write my exams.&#x201D;Nobuhle says Dladla contributes to her accommodation from his own pocket. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s like a father to me, he&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201D;Dladla said when Nobuhle was in Grade 8 he was the principal. This year he asked the deputy principal, Thamsanqa Justice Mtshali, to identify a pupil who needed his help. &#x201C;I just want to make a difference,&#x201D; he says. Nobuhle says Mtshali, who is also her history teacher, is &#x201C;amazing&#x201D;. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t an A student until him,&#x201D; she says.Nobuhle hopes to study the arts next year at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, or further afield.&#x201C;God will make a plan,&#x201D; she says, with that smile.

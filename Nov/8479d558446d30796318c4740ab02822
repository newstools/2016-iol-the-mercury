Durban - A family home in Puntan&#x2019;s Hill, Morningside, which is about 100 years old, was petrol-bombed and destroyed on Sunday night in a suspected dispute over land.A mother and her daughter living there had a narrow escape as unknown people, suspected to be from a nearby squatter camp, set the house alight with the victims inside begging for their lives.The elder woman escaped with first-degree burns to her hand and forehead. The fire gutted the house and its contents, and the roof caved in. All that remained was the shell of the structure with cracked concrete walls. A car parked outside was burnt out.The daughter, who asked not to be named, said the attack happened about 11pm on Sunday: &#x201C;We were asleep. They started breaking our windows - the bedroom, the lounge and the kitchen windows. We begged them to stop.&#x201C;Then they threw petrol bombs - one in the car and three in to the house - and they walked away. My neighbour said there were about 10 of them. She said her mother suffered first-degree burns as they scrambled to get out of the burning house and to rescue whatever they could.&#x201C;We left with just the clothes on our back. Our home was burned, there&#x2019;s nothing left.&#x201D;The younger woman believed the attack was an attempt by some people in the squatter camp to forcefully take their land. She said it was not the first attack. Last week, a neighbour&#x2019;s car and garage were petrol-bombed and &#x201C;they sent a message saying we should watch our backs&#x201D;.A relative said the older woman had been living in fear for years since shacks started mushrooming in the area. She was intimidated and the shack dwellers began stealing water and electricity.&#x201C;They have been moving up and encroaching on our land,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;My uncle bought this house. He used his pension and he put everything he had into this it. We were raised here. This house was one the first to be built in this area, it is more than 100 years old,&#x201D; she said.Human Settlements MEC Ravi Pillay said: &#x201C;We are distressed at the burning of a home in Puntan&#x2019;s Hill on Monday night.&#x201C;Informal settlements is a complex terrain and a major feature of urbanisation patterns, especially in eThekwini.&#x201C;This matter is very prone to conflict and this is the third incident in the past year in the city that we have intervened to manage. We must stress that land invasions are unlawful criminal conduct that also affects the constitutional rights of citizens ,&#x201D; said Pillay.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of arson had been opened. &#x201C;The motive is unknown and No arrests had been made,&#x201D; he said.

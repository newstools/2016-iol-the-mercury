Johannesburg - An influential ally of President Jacob Zuma, Sandile Zungu, has called on adversaries of former public protector Thuli Madonsela to promptly take her State of Capture report on judicial review or comply with its recommendations.Zungu, a prominent businessman and Zuma&#x2019;s adviser on black economic empowerment policy, said if judicial review failed, Madonsela&#x2019;s report must be implemented unconditionally &#x201C;because that is what the rule of law and constitutionalism suggest&#x201D;.&#x201C;The state capture report definitely warrants further interrogation because if it is left where it is - in an inconclusive state - a huge cloud will hang over our heads as South Africans, and over our democracy.&#x201C;I think posterity will judge us very, very harshly, that we had an opportunity to get to the bottom of this issue, to deal with it unequivocally - if it doesn&#x2019;t exist or if it is a figment of people&#x2019;s imagination, or nip it in the bud if it is a reality,&#x201D; he said.The ANC and its youth league in KwaZulu-Natal have lashed out at Madonsela for releasing the report, which they described as incomplete and defamatory to Zuma.ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma accused Madonsela of having released the report to make a political statement.Zungu said those who were aggrieved or implicated in the findings had a legal right to take it for a judicial review.&#x201C;If they think the grounds for such a review are quite strong, they should not be blamed if they explore that,&#x201D; he said.The report had recommended that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, instead of Zuma, should appoint a suitable judge to lead the judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture.&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t fault that.&#x201D;Zungu said the issue of state capture should be of great concern, and if left unchecked it would create an uncertain future.

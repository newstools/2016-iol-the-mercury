Durban - President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s wife Nompumelelo Ntuli, who is known as MaNtuli, is determined to clear her name.The Sunday Times reported this weekend that Ntuli was still regarded as a &#x201C;suspect&#x201D; in the attempted murder of Zuma.Ntuli has been linked to a plot to poison Zuma in June 2014. She was ordered to leave Zuma&#x2019;s Nkandla home in January last year due to the allegations.It is understood that a case in connection with the allegations was opened at the Nkandla police station in the same month.On Sunday, Ntuli&#x2019;s lawyer Ulrich Roux confirmed that he had received a letter from national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams in which he indicated that Ntuli was being regarded as a suspect by the investigation team.Roux said his client had co-operated with the Hawks, who were investigating the allegations, and had given an affidavit to police in April last year.Roux said he had asked last month who was in charge of the investigation from the Hawks, but had yet to receive a response.He added that Ntuli wanted to clear her name as the matter had been &#x201C;hanging over her head&#x201D; for the past 18 months.&#x201C;It is very stressful and traumatic for her. She has been accused of being involved in an apparent attempt on the president&#x2019;s life, an allegation which is completely without substance. This matter has caused irreparable damage to her reputation.&#x201D;He also said that they wanted the matter to go to court so the evidence could be tested.&#x201C;This is an abuse of the process and procedure is not being followed. If the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) believes there is reason to prosecute, then there must be a summons issued or an arrest so that we can go before the court.&#x201D;He said Ntuli had not returned to Nkandla since last January and had made other accommodation arrangements for herself and her children.The Presidency has previously denied that there was such a plot against Zuma and the NPA said it could only speak to the relevant party regarding the matter.Ntuli has been embroiled in controversies in the past few years. In 2014 Tanzanian national Steven Masunga Ongolo made several allegations regarding Ntuli including that she had committed adultery. Ntuli reported Ongolo to the police for crimen injuria and said he had sent her threatening SMSes.Ongolo pleaded guilty later that year, claiming that he had been frustrated when Ntuli failed to help him secure business.He was fined R10 000 or three months in jail.

Durban - Companies who want to tender for work in the KwaDukuza municipality on the KZN north coast will have to form partnerships with emerging local companies.This is according to resolutions made by the municipality during a recent council lekgotla held in Drakensberg, and in the wake of repeated disruptions of contractors working on big projects in the province by those wanting a piece of the work.Municipal spokesman Sifiso Zulu said the municipality, in a partnership with ABSA and Ithala Bank, had trained 30 local emerging contractors so they would be able to work on big contracts.The council also resolved that 45% of the tenders from the municipalities should benefit women, young people and people with disabilities. Zulu said the resolutions had also been taken to prevent incidents such as disruption of municipal development projects, which has become widespread in Durban. A big company would get a R20 million contract, and currently there is nothing binding it to have a partnership with emerging companies, owned by youth, women and people with disabilities, in our procurement policy. We are now moving towards reforming our procurement policy so that when you get a job it is going to be a requirement, which is allowed in terms legislation and it terms of BEE, he said.Zulu said the council would adopt the new policy on Thursday. He said in the absence of the policy big companies would continue to be awarded contracts and this would leave nothing for emerging companies.The Mercury

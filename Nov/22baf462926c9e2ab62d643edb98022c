Durban - KwaZulu-Natal dams have recorded remarkable recoveries in water levels as a result of steady rainfall around the province.But, while the week&#x2019;s rainfall has offered some relief - and even helped to lift water restrictions on those supplied by the Hazelmere Dam - those in drought-stricken areas are not out of the woods.Authorities said while some dams recorded dramatic increases, the amount of rainfall remained below average.Corporate stakeholder manager at Umgeni Water, Shami Hari-chunder, said the situation in the Hazelmere system had returned to normal after a two-year drought and stringent water restrictions.The dam levels stood at around 40% in May.&#x201C;Following good rains from July to the present, the dam has risen to 70%, as at yesterday. All water restrictions in the supply area of Hazelmere Water Treatment Plant have been lifted. The areas affected are Verulam, Waterloo, Ballito, Umhlali, parts of Ndwedwe, Sea Tides and La Mercy.&#x201D;But he cautioned that much of the torrential rains had occurred in areas outside catchment areas.&#x201C;This does not assist dams as rain has to fall in the catchments to impact positively on dam levels. Rain that fall in urban areas make its way into drainage systems and the sea,&#x201D; said Harichunder.&#x201C;The current levels of dams in the Umgeni system are a reflection of the impact of the drought which began three years ago and intensified last year, leaving major dams in a serious situation of stress.&#x201D;He said below-average rainfall could be attributed to the El Ni&#xC3;&#xB1;o phenomenon.Below average&#x201C;The entire system is in a rainfall deficit situation, meaning this system has to receive above average rainfall to catch up,&#x201D; said Harichunder.Using Midmar Dam as an example, he said the rainfall received last month amounted to 77mm, when the average for October at Midmar is 105mm.&#x201C;This means the rainfall received remains below average and is already in deficit. Similarly, rainfall received thus far at Midmar Dam in spring this year is also below average. The level of Midmar Dam as at November 13 was 49%. This is an increase of 2% over the past week - an increase attributed to run-off from recent rainfall and the transfer of water into it from Spring Grove Dam. However, the current level of Midmar Dam is about 3% lower compared to the same period a year ago.&#x201D;The dam serves uMgungundlovu and Pietermaritzburg.Agreeing with Harichunder, Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said water-saving measures must continue.&#x201C;We will be treating the situation as we have been. Yes, there has been a lot of rainfall but we must remain cautious with our existing supply.&#x201D;The levels of other major dams in the Umgeni system yesterday were: Nagle (70%) and Inanda (65%).A year ago Inanda Dam was at 85% and Nagle 77%.These dams supply water to Durban and, in the case of Inanda, it also contributes to the water needs of the middle South Coast (Umzinto, Scottburgh, Pennington and Kelso) through the South Coast pipeline.Midmar is the second-largest dam in the Mgeni system, after &#xC2;&#xAD;Albert Falls. The level of Albert Falls yesterday was 25% and a year ago was 45%.Due to the continued low level of Midmar and deteriorating level of Albert Falls Dam, mandatory water restrictions of 15% have been applied in uMgungundlovu, Pietermaritzburg and much of Durban.Harichunder said weather forecasters at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research had predicted that good rains, possibly above average, were expected at the end of this year and/or in the first quarter of next year.&#x201C;The amount of water currently in dams will have to last until then. Stringent water conservation and strict adherence to water restrictions are required.&#x201D;Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesman Musa Mntambo said the rains would go a long way to reduce the strain on wildlife.&#x201C;We hope that we have seen the worst and the drought cycle is moving towards its end.&#x201D;The operations manager at Amakhosi Safari Lodge in Pongola, Alwyn Wentzel, said the drought had devastated the 5 000-hectare property, and had led to the loss of many animals.&#x201C;Grazing areas are in recovery, but we had to supplement the animals with feed. Now the Mkuze River is showing signs of recovery, which is a relief,&#x201D; he said. The Mercury IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook

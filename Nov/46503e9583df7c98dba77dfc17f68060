Durban - An ANC candidate for ward councillor in ward 1 in uMuziwabantu, Harding, has put his life in God&#x2019;s hands, following death threats that forced him into hiding under the guard of heavily armed security officials.Selby Maphumulo is looking to be the councillor in the hotly contested ward 1 and yesterday emerged for the first time in weeks to risk his life greeting voters and the community.He will replace ANC councillor Bongani Sikhosana, who won the ward posthumously after being gunned down earlier this year. Sikhosana was shot dead in his home in the run-up to the local government elections in August. The ward was previously under the NFP.ANC members remembered Sikhosana during the by-elections when they sang a song asking, who&#x201D;killed our leader Bongani?&#x201D;.While Maphumulo played down the threats, ANC members in the area said they were deeply concerned. They said that on at least two occasions suspicious people had visited his home while he was not there.&#x201C;To be honest I did not want this position, but the comrades wanted me to lead them so what could I do?&#x201D; Maphumulo, who is also chairman of his branch told The Mercury during a visit to a voting station yesterday.&#x201D;I have left my life in God&#x2019;s hands... whatever is meant to happen will happen,&#x201D; he said.Since being elected to stand as candidate during a branch general meeting last month, Maphumulo has been provided with bodyguards. Five heavily-armed security guards escorted him yesterday. He and his family have also been moved from their home.He played down the danger, saying there had not been any direct threats to his life.&#x201C;It was the rumours that we were hearing from people in the community. This (security) was a precaution. The previous candidate was killed when it was very quiet, so we needed to make sure that we do not get a repeat of that,&#x201D; he said.Maphumulo, who seemed to be a popular candidate in the area, said his family were not happy when he took the position.&#x201C;My wife was especially concerned but she is also in the ANC so she understands. I had never sought a higher position in the party and have always just wanted to be an ordinary member working with the community.&#x201D;He said should he win the elections he would return to work with the community.&#x201C;I am an employee in the Department of Health in the Eastern Cape. I don&#x2019;t think I will be quitting that job because being a councillor is not a full-time position.&#x201D;If elected, he said he would focus on the building of roads and houses, and sorting out water shortages in the area.The party&#x2019;s regional secretary, Mzwandile Mkhwanazi, said party members were not happy that no one had been arrested for Sikhosana&#x2019;s death. He said a decision had been taken to protect Maphumulo to ensure there was no repeat of what happened to Sikhosana.Mluleki Ndobe, the Harry Gwala District Municipality mayor, said ward 1 was known as a hotly contested area. He said Maphumulo had received threats via text messages, some of which were sent to his family.&#x201C;Once he has won, we will be consulting with the state agencies to conduct a security threat and decide whether security should be provided,&#x201D; Ndobe said.Speaking on the by-elections, he said he was happy with the turnout.&#x201D;Ordinarily the by-elections are poorly attended but from what we have seen the attendance has been above 50%.&#x201D;The results are expected on Thursday.
